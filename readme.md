# MSc Dissertation on Ontology Engineering
Exploring different methods of modelling Hokusai's *36 Views of Mount Fuji* woodcut collection with Protégé.

Three different approaches:
- **Closed** aims to be as faithful as possible to reality. Ontology is closed because there can only ever be 36 specific individuals in the ontology.
- **MVP** aims to capture the ontology in the most economical way possible. Open-world and sparse.
- **Open** aims to capture the ontology more accurately whilst still utilising the default OWL2 open-world assumption.

`search_ontology.pl` is a small perl script for viewing the ontologies for those without access Protégé (or for quick reference without opening multiple instances of Protégé).
